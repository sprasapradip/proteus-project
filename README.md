# Proteus Projects
Welcome to the Proteus Projects repository! This repository contains two projects designed and simulated using Proteus:

## Project-1: PCB Design 3D Visualizer & Circuit Simulation
In this project, we have developed a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design that includes a 3D visualizer and circuit simulation. The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of the PCB layout along with the ability to simulate the circuit and observe its behavior.

## Project-2: PCB Flasher & Rectifier
Project-2 involves the design and simulation of a PCB flasher and rectifier. The PCB flasher circuit is used to control the blinking of an LED or any other compatible component, while the rectifier circuit is used to convert AC (Alternating Current) to DC (Direct Current).

### Scoring Board using Arduino in Proteus
Welcome to the Scoring Board using Arduino in Proteus repository! This project demonstrates a simple scoring board system implemented with an Arduino microcontroller and simulated using Proteus.

## Project Overview
The Scoring Board project aims to create a basic electronic scoring system that can be used for various games, sports, or events. The system utilizes an Arduino board to keep track of scores and displays the scores on a simulated display in Proteus.

## Project Overview
The traffic light controller project aims to simulate the operation of a traffic signal system, including multiple traffic lights for different directions and pedestrian signals. The controller follows the standard traffic signal sequence to regulate the traffic and pedestrian movements effectively.
