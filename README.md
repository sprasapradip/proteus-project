# Proteus Projects
Welcome to the Proteus Projects repository! This repository contains two projects designed and simulated using Proteus:

## Project-1: PCB Design 3D Visualizer & Circuit Simulation
In this project, we have developed a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design that includes a 3D visualizer and circuit simulation. The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of the PCB layout along with the ability to simulate the circuit and observe its behavior.

## Project-2: PCB Flasher & Rectifier
Project-2 involves the design and simulation of a PCB flasher and rectifier. The PCB flasher circuit is used to control the blinking of an LED or any other compatible component, while the rectifier circuit is used to convert AC (Alternating Current) to DC (Direct Current).
